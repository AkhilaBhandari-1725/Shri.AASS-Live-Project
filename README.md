# Vertex-Technosys-Live-Project

This was my first Industrial Live Project i had worked on during my Industrail Trainin of 3 months at Vertex Technosys, Solapur 
(small scale company works on Live projects).

This Web Application is developed using PHP. Php is server side Scripting language and can be easily embedded into HTML. 
I made use of Template for HTML and CSS so as to complete my work sooner.
I used xampp server and PHpMyAdmin for database.

This project has two sides:
1) Admin (CRUD Operations for data storing)
   For CRUD Operation i used javaScript.
2) Client side Website. 

This was a greate experiance thorughout the traning , I earnt many more things (JavaScript, jQuery) and
now am pretty confident to develop a Dynamic Website.
